### Teaching Materials

I have decided to share the good stuff with you guys since we are in the home stretch now. A lot of the code is intentionally left uncommented so you can figure out how it works on your own!


#### Some Resume Tips
I also included a recent copy of my resume so you have something to base yours off of. I used [creddle.io](https://www.creddle.io) to build mine. 
There are a few components to a good dev resume:
- One page. No more. No excuses. Don't cram your text in with smaller font sizes - write and rewrite until you have something succinct yet explanatory. It should be readable when printed and completely fit on a letter size (8.5 x 11) piece of paper. 
- Tailor your resume to emphasize your projects and skills. Put 'Projects' and relevant 'Work Experience' above 'Skills', as it's a lot more compelling to see what you've done (and consequently what you CAN do) than read off keywords which will be listed in the 'Skills' section anyway.
- Contact info should be visible and grouped. At the very least, include Phone, Email, Github, LinkedIn, and your portfolio site. Don't put social media links on here outside of LinkedIn. Trust me - it's a bad idea.
- A mixture of technologies leveraged and the problems you solved with them as "Work Experience" bullet points. If you have never had a technical job, emphasize things like communication skills, technologies you used there, leadership positions, awards, etc.
- Include one-sentence descriptions to give them a feel for the overall project before listing bullet points.
- Education, despite being important, doesn't merit a top slot on your resume. I might remove mine entirely soon, as a matter of fact.
