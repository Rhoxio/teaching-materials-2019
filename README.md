### Teaching Materials

I have decided to share the good stuff with you guys since we are in the home stretch now. A lot of the code is intentionally left uncommented so you can figure out how it works on your own!


#### Some Resume Tips
I also included a recent copy of my resume so you have something to base yours off of. I used [creddle.io](https://www.creddle.io) to build mine. 
There are a few components to a good dev resume:
- One page. No more. No excuses. Don't cram your text in with smaller font sizes - write and rewrite until you have something succinct yet explanatory.
- Tailor your resume to emphasize your projects and skills. Put 'Projects' above 'Skills', as it's a lot cooler to see what you've done than read off keywords which will be lised in the 'Skills' section anyway.
- Contact info should be visible and grouped. 
- A mixture of technologies leveraged and the problems you solved with them as "Work Experience" bullet points.
- Include one-sentence descriptions to give them a feel for the overall project before listing bullet points.
